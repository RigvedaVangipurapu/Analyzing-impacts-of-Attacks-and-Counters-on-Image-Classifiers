# Analyzing-impacts-of-Attacks-and-Counters-on-Image-Classifiers

● To perform image classification for a custom dataset using Deep Learning

● Understand the impact of adversarial attacks, image perturbation, and image compression for performing image classification

● Machine learning (Deep Learning specifically) methods work better for pattern recognition in images compared to other algorithmic approaches.

Work done:

● Created a custom dataset having 5 classes, 500 images per class using Flickr API and another dataset having only adversarial attacked images

● Used Transfer learning to perform image classification using VGG and ResNet models and compare their performance

● Used Fast Gradient Method and Projected Gradient Descent Method adversarial attacks on images

● Implemented methods for adding random noise and image blurring

● Implemented PCA and JPEG compression for image compression
